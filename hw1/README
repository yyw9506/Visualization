Get some CSV-based data (see course slides for good sources)
at least 250 data points (the more the better)
at least 15 dimensions (fuse datasets to achieve this)
good mix of numerical and categorical variables (minimum 5 levels)

Your D3-based visual interface should be able to (10 pts each):
1. present a menu to allow users to select a variable and update chart
2. draw a bar chart if a categorical variable is selected
3. draw a histogram if a numerical variable is selected (bin it into a
fixed range (equi-width) of your choice)
4. on mouse-over display the value of the bar on top of the bar
5. on mouse-over also make the bar wider and higher to focus on it
6. mouse (with left mouse button down) move left (right) should
decrease (increase) bin width/size (for numerical variables only)
